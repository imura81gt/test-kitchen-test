> **Test Kitchen is an integration tool for developing and testing
> infrastructure code and software on isolated target platforms.**

## Getting Started Guide

To learn how to install and setup Test Kitchen for developing infrastructure
code, check out the [Getting Started Guide][guide].

If you want to get going super fast, then try the Quick Start next...

## Quick Start

Test Kitchen is a RubyGem and can be installed with:

```
$ gem install test-kitchen
```

If you use Bundler, you can add `gem "test-kitchen"` to your Gemfile and make
sure to run `bundle install`.

Next add support to your library, Chef cookbook, or empty project with `kitchen
init`:

```
$ kitchen init
```

A `.kitchen.yml` will be created in your project base directory. This file
describes your testing confiuration; what you want to test and on which target
platforms. Each of these suite and platform combinations are called instances.
By default your instances will be converged with Chef Solo and run in Vagrant
virtual machines.

Get a listing of your instances with:

```
$ kitchen list
```

Run Chef on an instance, in this case `default-ubuntu-1204`, with:

```
$ kitchen converge default-ubuntu-1204
```

Destroy all instances with:

```
$ kitchen destroy
```

You can clone a Chef cookbook project that contains Test Kitchen support and
run through all the instances in serial by running:

```
$ kitchen test
```

There is help included with the `kitchen help` subcommand which will list all
subcommands and their usage:

```
$ kitchen help test
```
